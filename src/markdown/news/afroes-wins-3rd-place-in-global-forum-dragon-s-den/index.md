One of our start ups [Afroes](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.Afroes.com) took the third prize of USD 8000 at the [5th Global Forum](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalforum2013.co.za) on Innovation and Entrepreneurship which ended in East London on the 31 of  May and was chosen among top 50 international companies which had entered the [Dragon’s Den Pitching Competition](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalforum2013.co.za)

Founded by Ms Anne Shongwe, Afroes inspires the conversations and choices of young Africans through branded digital media and social responsible campaigns rooted in the African context. Afroes creates uniquely African mobile applications and tools for social development agencies and corporate enterprises keen to spread educational and branded messages across the continent. It also represents an unprecedented opportunity to deliver branded and education messages directly and repeatedly into the hands and pockets of potential customers and citizens across the continent and beyond. Afroes is hosted by mLab.

mLab CEO [Derrick Kotze](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za) said “we are very excited that Afroes has won such a coveted prize. It is important for African based start-ups to get the opportunity to pitch in front of a global audience to win mind-share in the mobile innovation space. Anne is an amazing role model not only for young innovators and entrepreneurs but also for women across Africa.”
